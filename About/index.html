        <h1>Hi, I’m Tal Hadad.</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          I’m a performance-driven marketer and software engineer. I built RankMind around one principle:
          <strong>real results—calls and conversions—backed by 100% transparency.</strong>
        </p>

      <section class="card" aria-label="My journey">
        <h2>From engineering to real-world impact</h2>
        <p>
          Technology and computers have always been a big part of my life. From a young age, I was drawn to understanding
          how systems work—but for a long time, I wasn’t sure how to turn that passion into something meaningful.
        </p>
        <p>
          After my military service, I committed fully and studied <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, including a
          <strong>Master’s degree</strong>. I then entered a “classic” high-tech office role. On paper, it was perfect.
          In reality, it didn’t feel right.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to build something with clear impact—something I could measure and improve.
          That’s when I started helping family businesses: building websites, managing Google Ads, and doing organic SEO.
          Suddenly, everything clicked.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
          I saw results in real time: rankings rising, calls coming in, and feedback like “our phone won’t stop ringing.”
        </p>

        <p>
          That direct impact changed everything. I left my job and dedicated myself to mastering marketing at the highest
          level—because I believe <strong>visibility is the core of every business</strong>.
          No visibility means no calls. No calls means no business.
        </p>

      <aside class="card" aria-label="What RankMind stands for">
        <h2>What RankMind stands for</h2>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>100% transparency:</strong> you always know what we do, why we do it, and what it produces.</li>
          <li><strong>Results-first:</strong> the KPI is calls and conversions—not vanity metrics.</li>
          <li><strong>High-level execution:</strong> advanced tools, models, and a deep competitive view.</li>
          <li><strong>Built for every stage:</strong> from brand-new businesses to teams scaling aggressively.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="section-title">The deal</div>

          <strong>No results? You shouldn’t pay. Period.</strong>

    <section class="card" aria-label="AI Platforms and AEO">
      <h2>AI Platforms & AEO — the next advertising revolution</h2>
      <p>
        RankMind doesn’t stop at traditional Google SEO. We specialize in
        <strong>AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)</strong>—the next evolution of search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, people don’t just search on Google. They ask questions on <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, <strong>Gemini</strong>,
        <strong>Perplexity</strong>, <strong>Claude</strong>, and other AI platforms. If your business doesn’t appear there,
        it’s invisible.
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Readable to AI models:</strong> structured content and technical foundations that machines interpret correctly.</li>
        <li><strong>Built around real questions:</strong> aligning pages with how customers actually ask and decide.</li>
        <li><strong>Positioned as “the recommendation”:</strong> not just ranking—becoming the answer engines trust.</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:12px;">
        This isn’t a trend—it’s a shift. Businesses that move now will lead tomorrow.
